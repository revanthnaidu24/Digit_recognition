This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to digit recognition using the popular MNIST dataset. The goal is to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) with high accuracy, leveraging neural networks.

Key Features
Dataset: The MNIST dataset, containing 60,000 training and 10,000 testing grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels).
Model: A custom-built neural network (or pre-trained model, if applicable) designed for optimal performance in image classification tasks.
Framework: Implemented using TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch, based on your implementation).
Training: Includes techniques like data normalization, dropout, and early stopping to enhance accuracy and generalization.
Evaluation: The model achieves a test accuracy of X% (replace with your result), showcasing its effectiveness.
